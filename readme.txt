Jupyter notebooks used to train and apply a mask R-cnn model  to classify live maerl in imagery of the sea-bed obtained from drop-down cameras. 
Originally based on https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN Also see this repo for more examples (in samples folder) and explanation of config parameters.
Platform used in this instance : JupyterLab on MAGEOHub (massive online GPU for Earth Observation at Plymouth Marine Lab).
This is a binary classification of live maerl/ not live maerl.

Many thanks to Dan Simms (University of Cranfield) for code examples and Stephen Goult & Dan Clewley  (Plymouth Marine Laboratory/ NEODAAS) for troubleshooting suggestions and use of MAGEO.
